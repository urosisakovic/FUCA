# FUCA

<p>
    FUCA is a web application built for an imaginary local amateur football competition.
    It has been built as a team project as a homework assigment for the Principles of 
    Software Engineering course taught at school of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.
</p>

<p>
    It is built using Python Flask web framework. All the source code is located
    in /src subdirectory, whereas in /docs subdirectory other documentation files reside.
</p>

<p><b>
    All the source code is written using Enlish language for the sake of not combining
    Serbian terms with the English ones. However, all the documentation files are written
    in Serbian because they are created as a homework assigment for the course at the
    University of Belgrade.
